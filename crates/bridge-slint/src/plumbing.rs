//! STRIP-2a: the PLUMBING - how a needle gets printed, how a line ending is normalised, how a
//! command reaches the port, and how the two window decorations (title strip, unsaved dot) are
//! written. These are not decisions, and they are not the probe's either: they are the small
//! mechanical layer every root needs, which is why surface.rs used to reach them with a glob
//! import of the crate root and a comment saying "that is not hygiene". This file is the answer to
//! that comment - the reach is now an import list naming seven things.
//!
//! The rule the moved bodies keep: report() is the ONLY writer of the `notes-gpui: ` prefix (the
//! smoke contract), lf() is the ONLY line-ending normaliser, publish_title()/note_dot() are the
//! only writers of the strip and the dot, send() never blocks. Nothing here decides anything about
//! documents; see surface.rs for that half.
